Usage
-------------------

Every file/folder of this repo is a representation of a concept that exists in
my head. These concepts MAY interfere with concepts of others people's mind.
A concept is referenced by a hashtag `#` followed by the unique name of the
concept, e.g. `#rain`. There MUST be a file or a folder that has the unique
name of the concept. All concept files SHOULD use #markdown_syntax and the
file extension MUST be `.md`.
