MIND
===================

This #git_repo is my mind.

Usage
-------------------

Every file/folder of this repo is a representation of a concept that exists in my head.
These concepts MAY interfere with concepts of others people's mind.
A concept is referenced by a hashtag `#` followed by the unique name of the concept, e.g. `#rain`.
There MUST be a file or a folder that has the unique name of the concept.
All concept files SHOULD use #markdown_syntax and the file extension MUST be `.md`.
